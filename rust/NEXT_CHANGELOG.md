# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v2.7.0

### Major Changes

### New Features and Improvements

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Arrow Flight recovery sender lifetime: replacement senders are now published
  only after pending replay succeeds, while initial supervisor handoff and failed or
  cancelled replay promptly drop redundant senders instead of retaining incomplete
  `DoPut` request channels until later teardown.

### Documentation

### Internal Changes

- Reorganized Arrow Flight under `stream/arrow/` with focused API, connection,
  ACK, supervisor, and batch modules and no public API changes. Its tracing
  target now follows the module path:
  `databricks_zerobus_ingest_sdk::stream::arrow`.
