# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v2.4.0

### Major Changes

### New Features and Improvements

### Bug Fixes

### Documentation

- Reworked ingestion docs to lead with the high-throughput pattern (ingest in a loop, then `flush()` once) and explicitly warn against calling `wait_for_offset()` after every record. Updated the README, crate- and method-level doc comments (`ingest_record_offset`, `ingest_records_offset`, `wait_for_offset`, `flush`), and the `json`/`proto` single-record examples accordingly.
