# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v0.2.0

### New Features and Improvements

### Deprecations

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a use-after-free in which a custom `IHeadersProvider` could be freed
  while the Rust core was still inside a `GetHeaders()` call into it during
  connection recovery. Provider ownership is now handed to the FFI via the new
  `free_user_data` destroy callback, which releases the provider's `GCHandle`
  only after any in-flight `GetHeaders()` has returned; the stream no longer
  frees the handle on dispose. This applies to both the synchronous
  (`CreateStreamWithHeadersProvider`) and asynchronous
  (`CreateStreamWithHeadersProviderAsync`) creation paths. Tracks the FFI
  signature change to `zerobus_sdk_create_stream_with_headers_provider` and
  `zerobus_sdk_create_stream_with_headers_provider_async`. No public API change.

### Documentation

- Corrected installation and source-build prerequisites, separated JSON and
  Protobuf stream examples, added a runnable generated-message example, and
  replaced per-record waits with one final flush in bulk-ingestion examples.
- Documented that `GetUnackedRecords()` can fail while the stream is still
  active after a flush timeout, and stopped reporting success after ingest
  failures. Pointed CONTRIBUTING at `src/Zerobus/Native/`.

### Internal Changes

- Made the .NET release workflow build-only, consistent with the other SDKs. It now packs the NuGet package and uploads it as an artifact; publishing and the GitHub Release happen downstream.

### API Changes
